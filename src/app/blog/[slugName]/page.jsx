Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly transforming industries, economies, and daily life. Its ability to process vast amounts of data, learn from patterns, and make intelligent decisions is driving innovation across sectors like healthcare, finance, manufacturing, marketing, and logistics.

           AI also plays a major role in improving customer experience through chatbots, recommendation engines, and real-time support. In education, AI-powered platforms personalize learning experiences to meet individual student needs. However, with its rapid growth, AI raises ethical concerns such as data privacy, job displacement, and algorithmic bias. While it streamlines processes and creates new opportunities, it also necessitates thoughtful regulation and responsible use to ensure it benefits society as a whole.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7">
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced a draft rule that empowers debit, credit, and prepaid card users to select their preferred card network. This rule challenges the existing practice card network options are predetermined by agreements between issuers and networks.

The RBI proposed that from October 1, 2023, credit card issuers will have to give customers the option to choose the network of their choice. According to a draft circular by RBI, card issuers would be prohibited from entering into any agreement with card networks that limit them from availing the services of other card networks. The rules would be applicable to both banks and non-banking financial companies that issue credit cards, debit cards, or prepaid cards.

Authorised card networks currently tie up with banks/non-banks for the issuance of debit, prepaid and credit cards. However, the choice of a affiliated network for a card is decided by the card issuer. This choice is also linked to the arrangements that the card issuers have with the card network. In the circular, RBI informed that   "arrangements existing between card networks and card issuers (banks and non-banks) are not conducive to the availability of choice for customers"          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mt-4">
            <strong>In 2021, the RBI the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> mposed an indefinite prohibition on Mastercard, American Express, and Diners Club, preventing them from issuing fresh debit, credit, or prepaid cards to customers due to their failure to comply with rules regarding local data storage. However, in June 2022, the ban was lifted by the central bank after confirming that the companies had adhered to the regulations concerning the storage of payment data.      </p>

            In India, where sweets spell celebration, the chances of being sugar
            dependent are high. What's worrying is that most of us are clueless
            about the amount of sugar we consume in a day. In the last 50 years,
            sugar consumption in India has gone up from 5% to 13% of sugar
            produced globally.

            So what harm can sugar do? It provides empty calories or false
            nourishments. In simple terms, it means it provides you energy but
            no nutritional sustenance. In fact, processed sugar (table sugar)
            has no minerals and often leeches minerals from the body.

              <p>
                A balanced and nutritious diet can positively impact your mood, whereas consuming excessive added sugar and processed foods can potentially influence your emotional well-being.

              <p>
                Foods that contain a high amount of added sugar cause a rapid
                increase in blood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in a
                temporary surge of energy. However, this energy boost is
                short-lived.

                Wrinkles are a natural sign of skin aging. However, poor food
                choices can worsen wrinkles and speed up the aging process. A diet rich in refined carbohydrates and sugar can increase the production of AGEs.
